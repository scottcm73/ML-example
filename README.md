This program uses machine learning to predict the weight of various species of fish. The winning algorythm, which happens to be the least complex, just finds the average of the lengths, then multiplies them by the height and width and then by .26, a number that I figured out by trial and error. This is not an especially particularly good model, but it is the best of what I came up with. The model is implemented in the model3 function which takes a csv_path to the test data as a parameter.
