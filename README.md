This program uses machine learning to predict the weight of various species of fish. Various models were tested with find_best_model.py. The mean squared errors for the algorithms were compared.  A Random forest regression algorithm had the lowest mean squared error.  

Run best_model.py to see the results of the random forest regression. The function for the random forest regression takes a csv_path of the test data as a parameter. It returns both the predicted y value (the y_pred variable) and the actual y value (the y_test variable).
